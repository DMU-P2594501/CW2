<!-- About Noel Gallaghers High Flying Birds (NGHFB) -->
  <h2>Who are Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds</h2>
<div class="About">
  <p>Noel Thomas David Gallagher was born on the 29th of May in 1967 and is known for being the main song writer for Oasis and considered the key to their success. After leaving Oasis in 2009, Noel wanted to try something new. He formed High Flying Birds later in the same year as the infamous breakup, becoming the lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter. The main band members besides Noel consist/consisted of Russell Pritchard, Mike Rowe, Jeremy Stacey and Tim Smith. With total creative freedom, it allowed Noel to produce songs that he was interested in making with no preasure with making songs that Oasis were use to creating. This different style with some simularities, it gave Oasis fans a breath of fresh air and he even managed to attract more fans who may of not liked the music that Oasis were producing. The band have since produced 3 albums and 3 EPs with many succesfull singles. Even with the independant success, he has faced critism from "hardcore" Oasis fans for not producing songs that the former band didn't get the chance to finish. They say he sounds completely different to the old sound that they are use too and therefore prefer Liam's solo music as it has both new material whilst staying loyal to the old material. Noel came out several times in interviews stating that he doesn't care as he produces music that he's interested as it isn't a job for him. This being said, he has recently come out to say that he will be looking into old unfinished Oasis songs and has said he will be finishing them - without Liam.
