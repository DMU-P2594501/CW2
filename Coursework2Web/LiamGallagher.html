      <h2>Who is Liam Gallagher?</h2>
    <div class="About">
      <p>William John Paul Gallagher was born on the 21st September 1972 and is known for being the lead singer in the band Oasis (1991-2009). William is most known as Liam and was/is also nicknamed Our Kid (RKID) by his brother Noel Gallagher and the fans. Liam formed Oasis with three friends before asking his brother to join them. He is known by many for being the outspoken and violent member of Oasis but has somewhat calmed down over the years which is most likely to do with him quiting drugs and drinking less. This came about due to the lack of quality with his vocals which were affected massively in the later years of Oasis and his career with Beady Eye. During his years in Oasis, Liam had a famous rivalry with the media as he often came to blows with them which would make the media/press even more determined to report on him and his "hooligan manner" as it was seen as brilliant entertainment by Liams fans and the rest of the public. After the split of Oasis, Liam was left with the other members of Oasis and a big decision to make. Instead of carrying on the name Oasis, he formed a new band called Beady Eye. Liam and three other former Oasis members (Andy Bell, Gem Archer and Chris Sharrock) carried on producing music and going on tour from 2009-2014, when the band finally dispanded. Even though Beady Eye had a decent fan base. It was unable to capture the magic that Oasis once had and left many thinking Liams career was over which was the complete opposite for Noel Gallagher and his new band High Flying Birds. In addition to this, it made many believe that wihtout the brain of the operation (Noel), that Liam would forever struggle to produce music up to the standard set by Oasis, this included the lyrics and music.

<!-- The Comeback -->
<h2>The Comeback Of Liam Gallagher</h2>
<div class="Comeback">
<p>After the break up of both Oasis and Beady Eye, Liam was left wondering the question of what now? He began to heavilly drink and was not in a good place mentally as he was in a state of denial. He truly thought it was all over. As well as this, the press were still on his back which added more and more preasure. This was until he told his other older brother (Paul Gallagher) to go on holiday with him where all he did was get drunk. He began to open up to his brother and girlfriend about his struggles which turned out to be ideal for him as they both encouraged him to pick up a guitar and start playing without the stress of producing anything for anyone. Because of this, he was able to play just for the fun of it instead of play because it was his job, this helped gather a little spark within him to start to write a few songs. It was not untill a few years later when he was given a guitar in a pub and was then recorded playing and singing a new song (Bold). This clip went viral on social media as Oasis fans, both old and new, began to hype up and hope for a return of the rock 'n' roll star. This turned out to be a big reason for Liams return as the buzz became a motivator for him to start producing music again and therefore his debut solo album. This was called As You Were and was released in 2017 which helped complete one of the best comebacks in rock 'n' roll history. Since then, he has released a second solo album (Why Me! Why Not?) and has arguably, started to outshine his brother Noel. This fact is also mainly spoken because of recent events as 4 years ago, on his comeback tour. Liam won over the fans by an incredible gesture of returning to Manchester after the horrific terrorist attack at an Ariana Grande concert. He postponed his performance in Germany and flew over the very same day as the One Love Concert took place to pay tribute to the lives lost by singing songs such as Live Forever. Many fans were baffled as to why Noel didnt show up to perform as it was seen as the perfect time to put grudges aside to perform infront of their home crowd.
